- Null hypothesis ($H_0$) -- average Lithuanian male height is 175cm.
- Alternative hypothesis ($H_a$) -- average Lithuanian male height >175cm.

Null hypothesis is rejected if the p-value <= $\alpha$ value picked before the experiment.

_p-value_ -- is the probability of getting the observed value (e.g. sample mean) of the test statistic, or a value with **even greater evidence** against $H_0$, if the null hypothesis is actually true.

```{r}
mu = 175
sample = rnorm(100, 181, 10)
alpha = .05
p = mean(sample)
se = sqrt(var(sample) / length(sample))
t = (p - mu) / se
# pnorm sums dist from -inf to z value (t). In order to get the prob of getting the t statistic as extreme or even more extreme, we subtract the pnorm sum result from 1.
p = 1-pnorm(t)
reject = p <= alpha
reject
```
